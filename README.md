# ToDo_App
a simple task planner as a web app to learn java script programming

after i saw this [video][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWLDAAMsD-c] i tried to extend the functionality a little bit

it is kept very simple and still works as it should

just download the repo and open the index. The rest is pretty self-explanatory and intuitive.
